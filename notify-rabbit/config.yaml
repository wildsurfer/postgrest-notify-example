# Example configuration in YAML

databases:
    # Local test database
    test:
        enabled: true
        host: localhost
        port: 5432

# Notify listeners
# These are used by the notify-rabbit.js application which connects
# to each database and adds a notify listener so that postgresql code
# can issue NOTIFY('key','message') and that message is sent to
# a rabbitmq instance
notify:
    -
        # Is this notifier enabled, disabled if absent/ !true
        enabled: true
        # Database to connect to (required)
        database: test
        # The notification name to listen to (required)
        name: mychannel
        # Log the message and meta data to the console (optional)
        debug: true
        # Convert the payload into json (optional) defaults to false
        json: true
        # Handlers to use. This is a map of handlers and any config they
        # require. The config format is specific to each handler. Also
        # An app doesn't have to support a handler, just define them
        # when calling the notify() method
        handlers:
            # Example handler, logs the payload to the console (optional)
            #console: true
            # Rabbit instance to use
            rabbit:

                # Topic to use, defaults to amq.topic (required if rabbit set)
                #topic: amq.topic
                # key: use just a routing key and send entire message to that key
                key: job.status
                # Valid only if json:true if set then the key in the message
                # containing the routing key
                #routingKey: key
                # Valid only when routingKey is valid, the key of the message
                # containing the actual message. If missing then the original
                # message is sent instead
                #payload: body

# RabbitMQ configuration

    # Test rabbit instance with user guest, password guest on localhost.
